# Zedix

Welcome to this Zedix app ! 

## Get started
First, head to `config/parameters` and configure your app.
Once ready, you can launch the development environment.

```
npm run dev
```

OR 

```
yarn run dev
```

This will launch Nodemon so that your app automatically reloads upon change. Isn't that great ?
